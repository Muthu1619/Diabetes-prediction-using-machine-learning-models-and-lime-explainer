# Diabetes-prediction-using-machine-learning-models-and-lime-explainer
This project focuses on preparing a real-world Diabetes dataset (2019) for machine learning classification. The goal is to clean, transform, balance, and scale the dataset, so it can be used to train models (e.g., LightGBM) to predict whether a person is diabetic.
